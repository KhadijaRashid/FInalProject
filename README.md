# FInalProject
The project looks at the disadvantage neighborhoods of Pittsburgh and analyses if this disadvantage has any roots is racial discrimination, especially against the black communities. The disadvantage index is calculating by taking the following four variables into account from acs data from 2010 to 2019:
1.	percentage of families living below the federal poverty line 
2.	percentage of single female headed households 
3.	percentage of people over 25 years of age without a bachelorâ€™s degree 
4.	male unemployment for individuals over 25 years of age 

The project maps the disadvantage and the areas where a large number of black communities live. It graphs the racial composition across the years and looks at the poverty levels of each tract/neighborhood across the years.
